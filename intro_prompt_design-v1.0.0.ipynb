      "* **Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions:**  We need to transition to cleaner energy sources, improve energy efficiency, and change our transportation habits to significantly reduce our carbon footprint.\n",
      "* **Adapting to Climate Impacts:**  As climate change progresses, we'll need to adapt to rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and other impacts. This might involve building infrastructure that is more resilient to these changes.\n",

      "**1. Liquid Water:** Earth is the only known planet in our solar system with abundant liquid water on its surface. This is crucial for life as we know it, providing a medium for chemical reactions and transport, and acting as a temperature regulator. \n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Plate Tectonics:** Earth's crust is divided into plates that move and interact, causing earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and the formation of mountains and ocean basins. This dynamic process helps regulate the planet's climate and recycles nutrients.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Atmosphere:** Earth's atmosphere, primarily composed of nitrogen and oxygen, is a protective shield against harmful radiation from the Sun. It also traps heat, creating a hospitable climate and allowing for weather patterns. \n",
      "\n",
      "**4. Strong Magnetic Field:**  Earth's magnetic field acts as a shield against solar wind, protecting us from harmful charged particles. This shield is generated by the movement of molten iron in Earth's core.\n",
      "\n",
      "**5. Diverse Life:** Earth is the only known planet to harbor life, with an incredible variety of species adapted to different environments. This biodiversity is a result of complex interactions between living organisms and their environment, shaped by evolution over billions of years.\n",
      "\n",
      "**6. Moon's Influence:**  Our large moon, formed by a giant impact early in Earth's history, stabilizes our planet's axis, contributing to a relatively stable climate. The moon's gravitational pull also drives tides, which have played a significant role in the evolution of life on Earth.\n",

      "**1. Ferver em uma panela:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Escolha uma panela adequada:** Use uma panela com fundo grosso e tamanho adequado à quantidade de água que você precisa ferver.\n",

    "Another way to improve response quality is to add examples in your prompt. The LLM learns in-context from the examples on how to respond. Typically, one to five examples (shots) are enough to improve the quality of responses. Including too many examples can cause the model to over-fit the data and reduce the quality of responses.\n",

Pick examples that are representative of the scenarios that you need the model to learn, and keep the distribution of the examples (e.g. number of examples per class in the case of classification) aligned with your actual distribution."
